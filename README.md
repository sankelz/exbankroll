# exbankroll
i was mad at my dad bc he was like "banks are all that" so i made my own version of it in two hours knowing like one language. banks are not, in fact, all that. 
(but also this is super basic so there's no such thing as credit cards checks or privacy leave me alone okay it's like an 14th century trade system outline i would have been smart if i was born in the middle ages)
